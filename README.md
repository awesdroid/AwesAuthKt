# AwesAuthKt

[![Kotlin](https://kotlin.link/awesome-kotlin.svg)](https://kotlinlang.org/)  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)


This app is a demonstration of using [AppAuth for Android](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) and
[Google Sign-In for Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start) for OAuth2
and authentication.

### Architecture
This app implements the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) proposed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)

As of Android, it's inspired by an implementation from `Fernando Cejas's` repo [Android-CleanArchitecture-Kotlin](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture-Kotlin)

#### Android 3 Layers Architecture

#### Data Layer

### Adaption for This App
Since `AppAuth for android` and `Google SignIn` have both heavily relied on Android (Activity, Context, Uri, 
...), it is impossible to put their logic in `Domain layer`. Therefore I replace `Repository Contact` with `AuthDelegate`
to delegate business logic in `Data layer` and keep `Domain layer` a pure Kotlin library

### Achievements
- Clean Architecture + MVVM
- AppAuth for Android client implementation
- Google SignIn client implementation
- Coroutines
- Kodein for DI
- JUnit Test for database with RobolectricTest + Mockito + JUnit
- Android Instrumentation Test for database

### TO DO LIST
- JUnit Test for UI (It might be hard to do because `AppAuth` and `Google SignIn` use external Chrome to do authorization and authentication,
 it's hard to simulate user log in actions)

### AppAuth for Android
The app uses Google OAuth2 configuration `google_config.json`. To run it on your own, you have to
create a configuration json as the `res/raw/xxx.json`
```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR CLIENT ID REGISTERED IN YOUR OAUTH2 PROVIDER",
  "redirect_uri": "XXX.XXX:/",
  "authorization_scope": "openid email profile",
  "discovery_uri": "YOUR OAUTH2 PROVIDER'S URI TO FETCH DISCOVERY DOCUMENT ",
  "authorization_endpoint_uri": "YOUR OAUTH2 PROVIDER'S ENDPOINT FOR AUTHORIZATION",
  "token_endpoint_uri": "YOUR OAUTH2 PROVIDER'S ENDPOINT FOR TOKEN",
  "registration_endpoint_uri": "xxx",
  "user_info_endpoint_uri": "YOUR OAUTH2 PROVIDER'S ENDPOINT FOR USER INFO",
  "https_required": true
}
```

> NOTE: `redirect_uri` is exclusive with `authorization_endpoint_uri`, `token_endpoint_uri` and
`user_info_endpoint_uri`

### Google Sign-In for Android
The only need to run it is to place you client id in `res/raw/google_signin.json` like this
```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR CLIENT ID REGISTERED IN YOUR OAUTH2 PROVIDER"
}
```
